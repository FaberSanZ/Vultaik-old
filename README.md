  ##               Xultaik is a 2D/3D toy engine implemented in [VulkanÂ®](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)



## Overview
This toy engine is designed for the vulkan learning process, I mainly use it to experiment with graphical or computing techniques and you should not use it as a cerium product as it may have memory leaks and faulty or poorly optimized implementation

## Low-level rendering backend
The rendering backend focuses entirely on Vulkan and HLSL, however, the API greatly simplifies the more painful points of writing straight Vulkan.
