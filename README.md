  ##               Xultaik is a 2D/3D toy engine implemented in [DirectX 12Â®]([https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/directx-12-programming-guide))



## Overview
This toy engine is designed for the DirectX 12 learning process, I mainly use it to experiment with graphical or computing techniques and should not be used as a cerium product as it may have memory leaks and faulty or poorly optimized implementations.

## Low-level rendering backend
The rendering backend focuses entirely on DirectX 12 and HLSL, however, the API greatly simplifies the more painful points of writing straight DirectX 12.
